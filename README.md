The "Book-List" project is a web application built using React.js for the front-end, React Router for managing the application's navigation, and Firebase for user authentication. This setup allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their book collection seamlessly within the app. React.js provides a dynamic and responsive user interface, while Firebase handles the backend authentication, ensuring secure access to the app's features. The use of React Router enables smooth transitions between different pages, such as the login page, book list, and individual book details.
